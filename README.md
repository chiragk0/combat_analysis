# UFC Combat Analysis

### Motivation
<p> As a fan of the UFC and combat sports as a whole, I've always thought about the most common physical traits that can be attributed to champions in their respective weight classes, and more specifically, what makes the best pound for pound UFC champion.

### Objectives 

- Find the most effective stance (orthodox, southpaw, swtich, open stance, sideways) for fighting
- Identify the genetic characteristics and conduct popularity analysis of each weight division
- Visualize the most important determinants for a UFC champion.

### Results

- Among the three most commonly utilized stances in combat sports, the 'Switch' stance appears to be the most effective. We can see this in its adoption by fighters who exhibit the highest average win percentages, and by the fact that it has the lowest standard deviation. These findings suggest that most fighters who employ the 'Switch' stance tend to achieve results that are closest to the mean in comparison to the other stances. 'Southpaw' stance ranks as the next most effective, with 'Orthodox' (the most popular stance) occupying the last position. 
  - Also to note, the 'Orthodox' stance should have the lowest standard deviation due to its larger sample size, but it displays the highest standard deviation of all the stances (excluding sideways stance). Consequently, fighters who utilize orthodox stance may experience more disparate outcomes from the mean win percentage. It is important to note that many fighters' stances are not indicated in the original dataset so this analysis solely pertains to the fighters whose stance is listed.
