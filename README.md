### Motivation
<p> As a fan of the UFC and combat sports as a whole, I've always thought about the most common physical traits that can be attributed to champions in their respective weight classes, and more specifically, what makes the best pound for pound UFC champion.

### Objectives

- Visualize the most important determinants for a UFC champion.

### Ideas for the Future (More to Come!)

- Correlation matrix of a few columns w/ seaborn heatmap for color grading
- Multiple Regression Analysis to find deeper relationships between variables
- Analyze fighter performance to find their best chance of victory against another oppopent
